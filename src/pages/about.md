I'm Felix, a developer from south Germany. I'm self taught (although I have a degree in Media Computer Sience) and currently working for a company in Munich that develops solutions for Microsofts Business Central, but also offers products in Azure and the PowerPlatform.

## Projects

Aside from what I do at work (DevOps Engineer is my fancy buzzword-title) I am interested in Go and microservice architecture. I like to identify problems in my life and try to make the solution to them into a "product".

**[BC100](https://github.com/flexwie/bc100)**  
I have the great benefit that my company offers me a _BahnCard100_ (unlimited high speed rail in Germany) as part of my compensation. Only downside is that I have to keep a record of my job-related journey. For this I created a simple web app with Remix.

**[Monitoring Telegram Bot](https://github.com/flexwie/monitoring_bot)**  
Many parts of my personal and professional life require to receive and react to notifications. In trying to solidify the different ways they reach me (push, mail, messages, ...) I wrote a bot to contact me in the place that I also use for daily communication: Telegram. Currently it fetches TooGoodToGo offers and Azure alert notifications are planned as well.
